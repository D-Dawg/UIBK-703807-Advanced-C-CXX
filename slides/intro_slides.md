# Welcome to C++

or better

Welcome to

## C++ / Dark Souls

is...

- notorious for being *hard*
- looks easy at first glance
- easy to get wrong / fail completely
- lots of deaths (your program / you)

> "If your program segfaults, consider yourself lucky."

- - -

, but over time you will

- *get used to it*
- learn useful techniques
- learn how to prevent errors & pitfalls
- better understand its internals
- be able to overcome a presented challenge

- - -

, sounds tough, why'd I do that?

- succeeding feels extremely rewarding
- learned techniques can be applied elsewhere
- its not for everyone, hence you are special `<3`

C++ is used where the real shit happens:

- High Performance Computing
- Compiler Research
- Game Engines
